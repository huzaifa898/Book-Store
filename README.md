Certainly! Here's a refined version of your description in strong English:

I initiated the development of a MERN stack project by first establishing a server. Subsequently, I seamlessly connected it to a MongoDB database. To facilitate various HTTP requests such as POST, GET, DELETE, and UPDATE, I employed Thunder Client.

The project comprises three primary modules: Home, Books, and Add Books. In the 'Add Books' module, users have the ability to submit information about new books, which is then persistently stored in the database. The added books are dynamically displayed on the designated 'Books' route.

For efficient data fetching, I integrated Axios in the React-based frontend, ensuring a smooth communication flow between the server and the user interface. This comprehensive architecture allows for a robust and interactive web application, where users can seamlessly interact with and manage their collection of books
